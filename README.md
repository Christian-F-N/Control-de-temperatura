# Temperature Control with Fuzzy Logic and Arduino

This project implements a temperature control system using fuzzy logic and Arduino. The objective is to regulate the ambient temperature using a 5V motor, LED lights, and a display. Fuzzy logic is initially implemented in MATLAB and then converted into Arduino code.

## Hardware Requirements

- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- 5V motor
- LED lights
- Display

## Software Requirements

- MATLAB
- Arduino IDE

## Connections Diagram

Below is the connections diagram between the temperature sensor, motor, LED lights, and display:

## Implementation Steps

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the temperature sensor, motor, LED lights, and display to the respective outputs on Arduino according to the connections diagram.

2. **Implementation of Fuzzy Logic in MATLAB**: Use MATLAB to develop the fuzzy logic for the temperature controller. Define the input variables (ambient temperature) and output variables (motor power) along with the fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. Adjust and optimize the parameters as necessary.

3. **Arduino Code Generation**: Using MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, generate the Arduino code from the fuzzy logic developed in the previous step. This code will provide the implementation of fuzzy logic in Arduino, including membership functions and fuzzy rules.

4. **Uploading Code to Arduino**: Open the Arduino IDE, create a new project, and copy the code generated by MATLAB. Connect Arduino to your computer and upload the code to the Arduino board.

5. **Testing and Fine-tuning**: Perform tests of the temperature control system and make adjustments to the fuzzy rules and membership functions as necessary to achieve precise and reliable temperature control.
